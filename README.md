# A benchmark of solubility prediction methods
* All of the sequences in this study are stored in data/sequences.fasta
* The output from all of the benchmarked tools as well as experimentally validated solubility of sequences are stored in data/method-comparison.tsv
* Running benchmark-all.R performs all of the analyses in the paper. It generates and stores all of the figures in the manuscript in results folder.
